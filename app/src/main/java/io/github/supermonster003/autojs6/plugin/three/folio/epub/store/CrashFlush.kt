/**
 * Work that must reach disk even when the process is about to die from an uncaught exception
 * (roadmap P7.7: the reading position is saved before the crash). An owner registers a synchronous
 * flush while it holds unsaved state and cancels it when that state is gone. The first registration
 * installs the guard as the default uncaught-exception handler; on a crash it runs every flush (each
 * on its own, so a failing flush cannot stop the others) and then hands the throwable to the handler
 * that was there before, so the system still reports the crash and restarts the app exactly as it
 * would without the guard. Nothing is logged: the plugin writes no logs at all (roadmap P7.7).
